      Welcome to Paranoia!
      (instructions go here)

# HOW TO PLAY:
      #   Just press <RETURN> until you are asked to make a choice.
      #   Select 'a' or 'b' or whatever for your choice, then press <RETURN>.
      #   You may select 'p' at any time to get a display of your statistics.
      #   Always choose the least dangerous option.  Continue doing this until you win.
      #   At times you will use a skill or engage in combat and and will be informed of
      #   the outcome.  These sections will be self explanatory.
      # HOW TO DIE:
      #   As Philo-R-DMD you will die at times during the adventure.
      #   When this happens you will be given an new clone at a particular location.
      #   The new Philo-R will usually have to retrace some of the old Philo-R's path;
      #   hopefully he won't make the same mistake as his predecessor.
      # HOW TO WIN:
      #   Simply complete the mission before you expend all six clones.
      #   If you make it, congratulations.
      #   If not, you can try again later.

      You wake up face down on the red and pink checked E-Z-Kleen linoleum floor.
      You recognise the pattern, it's the type preferred in the internal security
      briefing cells.  When you finally look around you, you see that you are alone
      in a large mission briefing room.
